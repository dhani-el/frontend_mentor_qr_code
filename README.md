# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges helps to improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup.
- SCSS.
- Typescript.
- Flexbox.
- Mobile-first workflow.
- [React typescript](https://reactjs.org/).

### What I learned

1. I am going to  test setting one dimesion of an image and set the other to auto it seems to yeild better results.
2. When using percentages in css and it is'nt working for a major container (a replacement for the page ) it is probably an issue with the root dom element (#root if it hasnt been changed).

### Continued development
A QR code generator could come in handy. I will be researching QR codes and see if i can actually generate one instead of placing an image
